# September Steel

**September Steel** is a dark and flat theme for Visual Studio Code with a Material theme feel to the UI. The syntax colors are cut 'n pasted from [One Monokai Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azemoh.one-monokai) by [Joshua Azemoh](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Joshua%20Azemoh%22&target=VSCode).

The icon theme in the screenshot is [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) by [Philipp Kief](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Philipp%20Kief%22&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance).

I'm trying different color settings in v 0.0.13. Let me know if you don't like it or if you prefer the previous flatter version.

Enjoy!
